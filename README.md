# HealthMart
The project aimed to create a responsive online pharmacy portal for learning the basics of web development. The website included features such as an online shop where users could browse and purchase medications, as well as a shopping cart for managing their selected items. Additionally, the portal incorporated admin controls, user controls, and CRUD operations to ensure efficient management of the platform. The project served as a practical learning experience for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and SQL, enabling the development of a comprehensive online pharmacy solution.
